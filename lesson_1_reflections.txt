How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed all lines which changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can compare different versions of my code and revert changes if I went in
    the wrong direction.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatically: you can't forget, and it is less to do
    Manually: You can choose by yourself when to commit and add comments, rather
              than just having a timestamp

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Commiting more than one file makes it easier if you need to commit 
    manually. You can commit changes affecting multiple files in one go if they
    are linked to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I type git log and I see the different version of the file and with git diff
I can compare two of them to see what exactly was changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always revert.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My distance mesuring app.
