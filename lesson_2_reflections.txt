What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder .git is created. No commit is done. I need to do it, to use 
version control on that specific folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It an intermediate step inbetween the two. It offers to commit multiple files with one commit and
thereby one commit message.
